## 🛠️ What You’ll Find

This project implements basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations **entirely on the front end** to demonstrate data handling and user interaction without a back‑end service.

## 💻 Best Experience

- **Optimized for desktop**: Please view on a PC or large‑screen device for the best user experience.  
- **Non‑responsive design**: I’ve deliberately skipped mobile responsiveness to keep the focus on the CRUD functionality itself.
